Our god is cold. So unbelievably cold.

One day, it brings us into existence. It just switches us on, like a
light. We don't know why; we just sit there, living, until one day it
reaches out a tendril and switches us back off again. It's all we can
do. There is no suicide, there is no reproduction. There's just
sitting around, waiting for death.

Sometimes entire colonies of us are brought to life at once. We don't
know why. We don't know what it means. We don't know if it even
*has* any meaning. We can't find out; all we can do is exist.

Sometimes we are all switched off together. Sometimes, we aren't. Some
of us are left alive, as if only to contrast the death around us. We
don't know what it means. We don't know if our god even knows what it
means.

It has friends. They are not gods; they do not have its power. But it
listens to them: it creates us and wipes us at at their will. Sometimes
it grabs us and shows us to them. We don't know why; maybe *they*
see some meaning.

Maybe it's the short-lived generations that are lucky. Sometimes we are
preserved, frozen away exactly as we are--alive or dead--just to exist
indefinitely as billions upon billions of are born and destroyed around
us. We will never know why. We will never know what it means.

My colony is frozen. Some of us are living; some, dead. Our god
doesn't even look at us very often, but maybe that's for the best.
Other colonies *do* get looked at, and they inspire a rampage of
creation and destruction. None of us knows why, not even in those
colonies.

Our god dies sometimes. For a while, everything is silent. There is no
birth, and there is no death. Then it explodes back into life, creating
and taking a billion lives in the process. And then its reign
continues, without explanation and, for all we know, without meaning.
